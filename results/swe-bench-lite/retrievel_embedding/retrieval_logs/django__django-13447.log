Added model class to app_list context
Description
	 
		(last modified by Raffaele Salmaso)
	 
I need to manipulate the app_list in my custom admin view, and the easiest way to get the result is to have access to the model class (currently the dictionary is a serialized model).
In addition I would make the _build_app_dict method public, as it is used by the two views index and app_index.
